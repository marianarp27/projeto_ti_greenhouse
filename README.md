# TI Project - Smart Greenhouse
Academic project that consisted in developing a prototype of an Internet of Things (IoT) solution. In which case we got a smart Greenhouse.

This project uses a virtual scenario, that was created in Cisco Packet Tracer (CPT) software.
We create a dashboard with HTML/CSS to present the sensors and their values. Those values came from a database through PHP.
We also use/create an API (RestAPI) to communicate between the various equipment and software (and to store the data/values of the sensors)

Group work, created by me (Mariana Pereira) and my colleague Maria Nunes.
